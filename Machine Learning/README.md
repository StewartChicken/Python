I created this project to supplement my knowledge of Machine Learning. Since I will also be coding some of these algorithms in C++, recreating them in Python is a good way to consolidate the underlying logic behind each of the models I will be exploring. I also chose Python because of the many simple graphics packages (for data visualization). I include four different Machine Learning algorithms within this repository: Linear Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and K-means clustering. To learn these algorithms and their implementations, I watched various videos and courses online.
