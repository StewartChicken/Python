This script is a subsection of the DemoSat (Space Grant) project. More information can be found on my website. I wrote this script to decrease the complexity 
of reading/mapping the data recorded by the DemoSat payload sensors. Instead of manually inputting/mappng the data through excel, I utilized python's Pandas and
Matplotlib libraries to automate the process.
